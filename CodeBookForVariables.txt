Variables used in run_analysis.R program file and their meaning:

activity_labels_tb = The Activity levels read from activity_labels.txt file.
no_of_activities = The number of Activities present(Count of rows in activity_labels.txt).
meaningful_activity_labels_vec = Meaningful texts of the Activites.
features = The features data read from "features.txt" file.
features_vec = The actual features extracted from features variable.
y_test_tb = Variable that holds data read from y_test.txt file.
x_test_tb = Variable that holds data read from x_test.txt file.
subject_test_tb = Variable that holds data from subject_test.txt file.
y_test_activity = The actual activites extracted from y_test_tb variable.
y_train_tb = Variable that holds data read from y_train.txt file.
x_train_tb = Variable that holds data read from x_train.txt file.
subject_train_tb = Variable that holds data read from subject_train.txt file.
no_of_activities = Number of rows in Activity_labels_tb variable.
y_train_activity = The actual activites extracted from y_train_tb variable.
merged_data = The merged data set from test and train folder.
merged_columns = The column names for all 561 + 2(Subject and Activity) variables.
filtered_columns = The required columns that has standard deviation and mean(And Subject and Activity).
selected_data = The full data set only for the filtered_Columns.
meaningful_col_names = The meaningful text representation for selected columns.
subjectVector = The sorted numeric subject vector for processing data for tidy data. 
activityVector = The activity dataset to process merged data to tidy data.
tidyData = The processed easy readable tidy data.

Column Names used in the TidyDataSet.txt file and their meaning:

1. Subject: The subjects used in both test and training data. They are read from subject_test.txt
and subject_train.txt.

2. Activity: The activites used in the analysis. There are 6 activities in the activity_labels.txt
file. They are translated in to reading friendly meaningful texts.

3. Variable: The variables that are read from features.txt. They are translated into reading friendly
meaningful texts.

4. Mean: The mean of the variables for each subject and each activity comply with the idea of tidy data.
